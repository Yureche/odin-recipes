<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Black rice is one of the handful of superfoods. This rice is so flavorful and has a very unique presentation as it cooks up to a deep purple color. This rice goes great with just about any meal as a nice healthy side. I love to make it with salmon and a side of fresh veggies.
